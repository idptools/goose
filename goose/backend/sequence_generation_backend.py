def optimal_residue_key(four_amino_acids):

    """

    Function to translate amino acids in a sequence to the proper key for
    the dis_value dict. The dis_value dict holds the predicted disorder 
    values for thousands of distinct 5 amino acid combinations. To keep
    this dict from being so massive that it slows down GOOSE, the dict
    did not use every possible amino acid in the 4 amino acids that are
    used for prediting potential disorder values in the 5th amino acid.
    For example, all aromatics were treated as equivalent. This reduced
    the total lenth of the dict by several orders of magnitude.


    Parameters
    -------------

    four_amino_acids : String

    """

    Clever shortcut that allows bypassing predicting disorder
    of each amino acid for ever amino acid to be added to a sequence
    when generating a sequence. 

    Basically, a giant dict where 4 amino acids at the end of an IDR 
    were varied and then followed by a 5th amino acid. The 5th 
    amino acid tested was every possible standard amino acid. 
    The disorder value of the 5th amino acid was added to a
    list with known orders of amino acids (alphabetical).
    Now, that dict can be accessed to get approximate
    disorder values for potential amino acids to follow any 
    4 amino acids from a sequence being generated. This is 
    much faster than iteratively predicting sequence disorder 
    and is surprisingly accurate despite the massive assumptions that 
    had to be taken when making the dict.

    Importantly, this function will return a random amino acid from the
    list as opposed to the one with the highest value which gives
    GOOSE some stochasticity in sequence generation (generatiing the
    same sequence every time isn't all that useful...).

    Parameters
    -------------

    four_amino_acids : String
        The 4 amino acids used from the input sequence that

    exclude_residues : List
        List of residues to be excluded from possible residues to be
        returned.
    
    cutoff_dis_val : Float
        The cutoff value to be used for considering something as disordered
        Default: 0.7120440821228284
        Default determined by using the cutoff value equal to the average 
        predicted score in the dict + 1 standard deviation. Average disorder in 
        dict = 0.6397844593942738, stdev of scores in dict = 0.07225962272855471

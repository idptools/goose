functionality for generating sequences where
disorder is actually checked. The sequence_generation_backend.py
holds code simply for generating sequences that are used here. The
backend does not check disorder because it allows for more rapid generation

    '''
    function to check whether a generated sequence is disordered.
    The function allows some 'ordered' residues provided that 
    'strict' is not set to True.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sequence : String
        The amino acid sequence of the protein to check as a string

    disorder_threshold : Float
        The disorder threshold value. Higher values are more 'strict'

    strict : Bool
        Whether to allow for any residues below the disorder_threshold.
        If set to True, then if any residue goes below threshold, the sequence
        will not be considered disordered. Default is False.

    Returns
    -------
    Bool
        Returns True if sequence is disordered and False if not disordered

    Parameters
    ----------
    seq_length: int

    objective_dim : float
        objective rg or re value
    allowed_error: float
        Allowed error between the specified radius of gyration and the actual radius of gyration
        default is from the backend.parameters module, re_error or rg_error
    attempts : Int
        The number of times to attempt to build a sequence before throwing
        in the towel
    disorder_threshold : Float
        The value for a residue to be considered disordered.
    strict_disorder : Bool
        Whether to have a strict cutoff for disorder where if any single residue
        falls below disorder_threshold, the sequence is not considered disordered.
        Set to False by default allowing single residues to occassionally drop below
        the disorder theshold provided it is minimal. See check_disorder for more
        details.
    individual_rg_re_attempts : int
        Number of attempts to make the objective rg or re. 
        Does not account for disorder
    reduce_pos_charged : bool
        Whether to reduce positively charged amino acids in the sequence. 
        default is True
        Reason for this is that in vivo data suggests that positively charged
        residues may not drive sequence expansion as much as was predicted by
        the model used here for predicted rg / re. Therefore, when set to True,
        this function will largely avoid (+) charged residues.

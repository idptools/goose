Tracking future changes...
• Update sequence_generation.py, sequence_generation_backend.py, and variant_generation.py functions to use numpy vectorize operations
• Slim down code base significantly
• Add explicit sequence feature verification post sequence generation. 
• reverify what fractions of amino acids should be max fractions. 
• Update all sequence generation methods including by interactions and for bydimensions to use numpy vectorized operations
• Fix the computeIWD parameter in the optimizer_parameters
• improve documentation, add more defualt probabilities based off of different genomes.
• Update the library generation functionality. 
• Update autosummary in docs. 
• Make sure no residual kappa errors (-1 for no charge or only same charge) arising from the new kappa code
• Reassess logic in making hydropathy by class variants, add in numpy vectorization version. 
• Fix the Colab Notebook!
